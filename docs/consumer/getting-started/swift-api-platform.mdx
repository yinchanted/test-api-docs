# Swift API platform

## What is Swift API platform?

Swift API platform aggregates all the Swift APIs in one place and provides a unified interface to access them.
Single identity and security models are used accross all the APIs.

## Key features

    <h2>Unified interface</h2>
    <p>
      Swift API platform provides a single point of access to all Swift APIs and
      simplifies the onboarding process for the API consumers and providers.

    <h2>Security & Identity</h2>
    <p>
      The same security layers used by traditional messaging system are embedded
      in all Swift API services to ensure data protection and confidentiality of
      all communication between the parties involved in the API flows.

## Getting started with the API

### 1. Read the documentation

We recommend to read the documentation first to get a better understanding of the API.

1. All security related information is described in the [security section](/docs/consumer/security/overview).
2. Architecture and design principles are described in the [architecture section](/docs/category/architecture).
3. API reference is available in the [developer portal](https://developer.swift.com/reference).

Once you have a better understanding of the API, you can proceed to the next step and make an API request.

### 2. Make an API request

#### Create an application

To make an API request, you need to create an application first.
Follow the steps described in the [application creation guide](/docs/consumer/security/application-credentials).

#### Make an API request

We have prepared an example of how to make an API request using cURL tool.
You can follow the steps described in the [making your first API call](./making-first-api-call).

### 3. Moving to production

Once you have tested the API in the sandbox environment, you can proceed to the production/test deployment.
Information refering to the production deployment is available in the [deployment section](/docs/category/deployment).
