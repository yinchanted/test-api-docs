# Making your first API Call

## Introduction

:::info
For more information about the OAuth authentication process, see the [OAuth Authentication](/consumer/security/oauth-authentication) guide.
:::

Swift APIs are secured using OAuth 2.0. This means that you need to authenticate before you can make an API call.

import OAuthJwtSequenceDiagram from "../security/_oauth-jwt-sequence-diagram.mdx";

<OAuthJwtSequenceDiagram />

## Application credentials

For the purpose of this example, we provide the application credentials for the `sandbox` environment
but **you can use your own application credentials**.

You can create a new application following the [Application credentials](/consumer/security/application-credentials) guide.

import AppCredentials from "@site/src/components/make-api-call/AppCredentials";

<AppCredentials />

## Steps to make an API call

import BoxLayout from "@site/src/components/box/BoxLayout";
import Box from "@site/src/components/box/Box";

<BoxLayout>
  <Box to="#step-1-generate-the-json-web-token-jwt">
    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <h4>Generate the JWT</h4>
    <p>Generate the JWT assertion using the channel certificate.</p>
  </Box>
  <Box to="#step-2-retrieve-the-oauth-token">
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <h4>OAuth token retrieval</h4>
    <p>
      Make an HTTP <code>POST</code> request to the
      <code>/oauth2/v1/token</code> endpoint to retrieve an OAuth token. The JWT
      assertion, the scope and the grant type are passed as parameters in the request
      body.
    </p>
  </Box>
  <Box to="#step-3-make-the-api-call">
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <h4>Make the API call</h4>
    <p>Use the OAuth token to make the API call.</p>
  </Box>
</BoxLayout>

### Step 1: Generate the JSON Web Token (JWT)

The JWT is used to retrieve an OAuth token and it is generated using the channel certificate and the application credentials.
For the purpose of this example, we will use a self-signed certificate.

#### Generate the self-signed certificate

Click on `Generate certificate` button to generate self-signed certificate. This certificate will be used to generate the JWT in the next step.

This self-signed certificate is only valid in sandbox environment.
You can read more about certificates in the [SwiftNet PKI](/category/swiftnet-pki) guide.
For production environment, you will need to provide a real certificate.

import Certificates from "@site/src/components/make-api-call/Certificates";

<Certificates />

#### Generate and sign the JWT

:::info
For more detailed information about the JWT generation, see the [JWT structure](/consumer/security/oauth-authentication#jwt-structure) guide.
:::

Click on `Generate and sign JWT` button to generate the JWT.
The JWT header and payload will be populated automatically and the token will be encoded and signed using the private key of the certificate.

Once the JWT is generated, you will be able to see the
JWT <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold"}} className="header">header</span>, <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold"}} className="payload">payload</span> and <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold"}} className="signature">signature</span> encoded in base64.

import Jwt from "@site/src/components/make-api-call/JWT";

<Jwt />

### Step 2: Retrieve the OAuth token

:::tip
In case of having any issue, you can check the [Troubleshooting](/consumer/troubleshooting) guide.
:::

Once you have the JWT, you can use it to retrieve an OAuth token. To do this, you need to make a POST request to the `/oauth2/v1/token` endpoint.

You can copy and paste the following cURL command in your terminal to make the API call.

import TokenRequest from "@site/src/components/make-api-call/TokenRequest";

<TokenRequest />

### Step 3: Make the API call

Once you have the OAuth token, you can use it to make the API call. We will make an API call to the `POST /swift-preval/v2/accounts/verification` endpoint to verify beneficiary account.

import PrevalRequest from "@site/src/components/make-api-call/PrevalRequest";

<PrevalRequest />

## Sample code

Swift provides sample code in different languages to help you get started with the API development.
You can find the sample code in Swift [GitHub repository](https://github.com) and more information about the sample code in the [Sample code](./consumer/sample-code/quickstart) guide.
