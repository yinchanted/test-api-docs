Swift SDK can be used to implement the Swift APIs in your application.
Swift SDK takes care of the lower-level plumbing including authentication, authorization, signing and error handling.

For more information about the Swift SDK, see the [Swift SDK documentation](https://developer.swift.com/swift-sdk).
