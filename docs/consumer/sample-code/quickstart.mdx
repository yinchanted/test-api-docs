# Quickstart

The sample code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com) and contains examples on how to retrieve a token using the JWT grant type and how to use the token to authenticate an API call.

### Create an application

1. [Create an application](./consumer/security/application-credentials) and select the API products you want to use.
   More than one API product can be assigned to an application and during pilot period the application can be modified to include more products.

2. Copy the **consumer key** and **consumer secret** values into `CONSUMER_KEY` and `CONSUMER_SECRET` environment variables.

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="unix" label="Linux and macOS">
```shell script
export CONSUMER_KEY=<consumer key>
export CONSUMER_SECRET=<consumer secret>
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
```PowerShell
$env:CONSUMER_KEY=<consumer key>
$env:CONSUMER_SECRET=<consumer secret>
```
```shell
set CONSUMER_KEY=<consumer key>
set CONSUMER_SECRET=<consumer secret>
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Start the application

This monorepo contains multiple sample code projects organized in subfolders.
The folder structure is as follows: `language -> framework(optional) -> project`

To start the application:

1. Navigate to the project subfolder, for example:

   ```shell script
     # cd language/framework/<project>
     cd java/spring-boot/messaging-api
   ```

   or

   ```shell script
     # cd language/<project>
     cd nodejs/messaging-api
   ```

2. Launch the application
   | Language | Command |
   | --- | --- |
   | Spring Boot | `./mvnw spring-boot:run` |
   | Quarkus | `./mvnw quarkus:dev` |
   | .NET | `dotnet run` |
   | NodeJS | `npm install && npm run dev` |
   | Python | `python -m flask run --port 8080` |

## Testing

REST API endpoints are exposed to quickly test the code and [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) can be used to easily execute the tests.

The Swagger UI page will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8080/test
