# Set up web server for certification

The certificate is used to secure the communication between the Swift API Gateway and the Bankâ€™s API Gateway.

The first step is to create the certificate in the [Online Operations Management](https://www2.swift.com/go/book/book107594) (O2M) application.
Your SwiftNet security officer should set up the Distinguished Name (DN) assigned to your web server for certification.
Once the certificate is generated in the O2M portal, a key pair is generated and the certificate is signed by the SWIFTNet CA.

## Certificate creation in O2M

The following web server certificate DNs structure should be used:

:::info
The \<Service\> value depends on the API product. This value is provided by Swift.
:::

| Environments | Web server certificate DNs | Example |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Live | cn= \<YourBank\>-\<Service\>.swiftnet.sipn.swift.com,o=\<YourBIC8\>,c=ww | cn=swhqbebb-preval.swiftnet.sipn.swift.com,o=swhqbebb,c=ww |
| Test and Training| cn= \<YourBank\>-\<Service\>-pilot.swiftnet.sipn.swift.com,o=\<YourBIC8\>,c=ww | cn=swhqbebb-preval-pilot.swiftnet.sipn.swift.com,o=swhqbebb,c=ww |

Below is a certification example, for the Payment Pre-validation Test and Training service, of a web server with DN: `cn=cclabebb-preval-pilot.swiftnet.sipn.swift.com,o=cclabebb,c=ww`.

For further use in next steps, please note down the **reference number** and **authorisation code**.
